This is a set of codes for training models, predicting images and plotting a map of an agricultural land based on the health status of the crops.
steps:
1. put all the py files onto the same folder.
2. prepare training images and test images forlders and mention that as the dir at 'prepareData.py' and 'scatter.py'.
3. first run preparedata.py
4. then trainModel.py
5. then run scatter.py for the mapping and predict.py for predicting one specific image
